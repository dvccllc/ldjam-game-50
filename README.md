## running idea

thanos delay the inevitable closing fist

each finger relates to a key or input 

each finger might be "closing" and requires some form of input

if a finger closes, you lose

you win by delaying the inevitiable 

as the game goes
- different fingers close requiring different input
- each finger should be controlled by an input

- mashing? sequence? 


- as difficulty increases compound multiple keys into a single finger
